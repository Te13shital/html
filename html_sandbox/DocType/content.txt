The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag;
it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML.
 The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

Tip: Always add the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to your HTML documents, so that the browser knows what type of document to expect.


The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.

The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).


The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.

The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.

The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

<title> (this element is required in an HTML document)
<style>
<base>
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<noscript>


In HTML 4.01 the <head> element is required.

In HTML5, the <head> element can be omitted.
